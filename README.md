# Smart_Watch_Project_ECEN_361_BYU-I
Our group project for ECEN 361

you should be able to clone this repository and import it into stm32cubeide just like with the class assignments.

I added in text documents with links to monday.com, the lucidchart for the code block diagram, and the hardware we have decided on so far. (feel free to update this as needed)

I made a copy of our first week project deffinition document and it is now in the repository.

When you eddit this repositoy PLEASE PLEASE remember to make a new branch first. Also it will save me a lot of time if you put your name in name of the branch and add detailed descriptions to your commits. 

Thanks for reading!
